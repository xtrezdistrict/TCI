                <p><strong>Trauma and Counselling Interventions</strong> is made of a group of therapists whose target clients are 
                    families, learners, men, women, youths, adolescents, and special populations. All our therapists are 
                    registered with the Allied Health Profession Council of Zimbabwe (AHPCZ). We have social workers 
                    on the team too. The grouping was formed in 2018, with the focus of targeting vulnerable 
                    populations and persons who cannot afford mental health and those who try to solve mental health 
                    issues metaphysically by coining them with evil spirits. With an increase in drug and person abuse, 
                    we, TCI have scaled up our operations to other districts and provinces from Harare Metropolitan 
                    province.
